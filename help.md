### AMADA

Welcome to the AMADA - Analysis of Muldimensional Astronomical DAtasets 

This interface provides a simple control for the R version of the AMADA package. The interface provies a visualization of different diagnostics for data exploration. The usear can switch between them using the different tabs.
